# JavaScript Tutorial

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.  
It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc on different websites -- all of that is built using JavaScript.  
Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.

## History of JavaScript
JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995.  
initially, it was named ***Mocha*** by the creator, which was later renamed ***LiveScript***. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to ***JavaScript*** with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community.  
Brief: **Mocha** > **LiveScript** > **JavaScript**

## Variable Declarations
To use variables in JavaScript, we first need to create it i.e. declare a variable. To declare variables, we use one of the **var**, **let**, or **const** keywords.  
<br>
**var:** This keyword is used to declare variables globally. If you used this keyword to declare a variable then the variable can accessible globally and changeable also. It is good for a short length of codes, if the codes get huge then you will get confused.  
<br>
**let:** This keyword is used to declare variable locally. If you used this keyword to declare a variable then the variable can accessible locally and it is changeable as well. It is good if the code gets huge.  
<br>
**const:** This keyword is used to declare variable locally. If you use this keyword to declare a variable then the variable will only be accessible within that block similar to the variable defined by using let and difference between let and const is that the variables declared using const values can’t be reassigned. So we should assign the value while declaring the variable.

## JavaScript Hoisting
JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables(var) or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

## Naming Rules
A variable name should accurately identify your variable. When you create good variable names, your JavaScript code becomes easier to understand and easier to work with. Properly naming variables is really important. JavaScript also has some rules when it comes to naming variables;  

* Variable names cannot contain spaces.

* Variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).

* Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.

* Variable names are case-sensitive.
