## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.  
It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc on different websites -- all of that is built using JavaScript.  
Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.

## History of JavaScript
JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995.  
initially, it was named ***Mocha*** by the creator, which was later renamed ***LiveScript***. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to ***JavaScript*** with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community.
